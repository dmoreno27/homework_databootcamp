PyCity_Schools Findings

1. Large school with sizes of 2000-5000 students on average, 
perform poorer than students attending schools of medium and 
small size. (1000-2000 students and less than 1000 students 
respectively. This is evident when comparing all provided 
metrics  of performance for each school size grouping: 
Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, 
% Passing Reading, % Overall Passing Rate. This reading may 
however be skewed by the variance in population sizes in each 
size grouping. Only 2 schools are represented in the small 
group grouping while there are 5 school represented in the 
in the medium grouping and 8 in the large.

2. In comparing the performance metrics of schools based on 
school type, there is appears to be a correlation between 
school type (district and charter) and performance. In all 
areas of metrics, students attending charter schools on average 
outperformed students attending district schools. The split 
between the two grouping (8 to 7) is fairly similar; however, 
the students represented within each school type group allows 
for this reading to perhaps be limited. The total sample 
contains data from 26976 students in district schools and 
only 12194 from students at charter schools. Additionally, 
on average district schools contain a larger quantity of 
students per schools than those of charter schools 
(3854 vs 1524).
