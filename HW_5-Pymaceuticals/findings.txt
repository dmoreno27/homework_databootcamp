PYMACEUTICAL FINDINGS

1. In comparing the effectiveness of the four select drugs (Capomulin, Infubinol, 
Ketapril and Placebo), Capomulin is the only drug to have observable positive 
impact on the size of tumors during the 45 day treatment period. Mice receiving 
the Capomulin treatment experienced a 19%  reduction in the size of their tumors
2. Similarly, mice receiving Capomulin were also the only mice to experienced a
lower rate of metastatic spread. 
3. Mice receiving Capomulin also experienced a greater rate of survival (reaching 
a low of ~80%) through the treatment period, while mice of other treatments more 
likely to not survive to the end of the treatment period (reaching a low of 
~35-~43%). 

These observations suggest that Capomulin is not only the most effective drug, 
but the only effective drug, of the four selected drugs to observe.
